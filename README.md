# NLP-ETL-tweets

>Repository status: Finished

An ETL pipeline with NLP techniques applied to tweets. I used the Google Cloud Natural Language API with its methods, spaCy and translate for preprocessing and of course Pandas as well.

I used Google Colab during development. 

The final ETL data is found in the "dados-tweets" within "Dados" folder and the dataset folder name is "dados_starfield" in the same folder.
